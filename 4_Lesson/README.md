## Lesson 4 - Sticky

A sticky-positioned element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified point during scrolling, after which it is treated as fixed. This is often used for creating navigation bars that stick to the top of the page after scrolling past a certain point.

```css
/* Syntax*/
#container {
  position: static;
}

#box-one {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}

#box-two {
  position: static;
}
```

![Sticky Sample Output](../images/sticky.gif)

Box one moved when I tried to scroll my screen to lower when reaching the `top:20px` of my screen.

### NOTE

- `position: sticky` will not work if top property is not defined.
- using both `top` and `bottom`, top will override the bottom. Same with `left` and `right`, left will override the right.

### Exercise

NOTE: Remember to modify the given code in start folder and as much as possible do not look the final output folder.

Try to add both boxes with `top` property with different pixels and observe the changes.

```css
#box-one {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  border: 2px solid red;
  position: sticky;
  /* Enter your code below */
}

#box-two {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  border: 2px solid blue;
  position: sticky;
  /* Enter your code below */
}
```
