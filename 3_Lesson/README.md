## Lesson 3 - Absolute

An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the <html> element).

```css
/* Syntax without positioned ancestor*/
#container {
  position: relative;
}

#box-one {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}

#box-two {
  position: static;
}
```

This is an example of an element that is `position: absolute;` without a positioned ancestor.

```css
/* Syntax without positioned ancestor*/
#container {
  position: relative;
}

#box-one {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}

#box-two {
  position: static;
}
```

This is an example of an element that is `position: absolute;` with a positioned ancestor.

### NOTE

- using both `top` and `bottom`, top will override the bottom. Same with `left` and `right`, left will override the right.

### Exercise

NOTE: Remember to modify the given code in start folder. As much as possible, do not look at the final output folder. If you are done you can check and compare the results to final output folder if it is the same.

In the CSS file, Try to add `left: 100px;` in the `#box-one` and observe the changes.

```css
#box-one {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  border: 2px solid red;
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px;
  right: 40px;
  /* Enter your code below */
}
```
